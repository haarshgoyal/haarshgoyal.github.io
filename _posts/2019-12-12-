> ‚ÄúBooks were great as the first best because books are incredibly unusual in one respect, that is that there are more items in the book category than there are items in any other category by far.

I will tell your **exactly** how I developed my reading habit in **13** simple points.

Also, I am going to give you the **best place** in the world to** download** your choice of e-book without spending a dime..

### Step by step guide to master reading

### **1. No big deal**

It all started by telling myself that it‚Äôs not a big deal for me to read at least 5 mins daily, any time of the day.

### **2.** Selective reading

The first thing my monkey mind starting wondering about was ‚Äî **what to read**? So if you don‚Äôt know where to start from, I will give you a hint:

Think of a problem you are facing in your personal or professional life..for me it was negotiating with my cofounder. So I went to google and searched for ‚Äúhow to negotiate like a pro‚Äù and tadaa¬†..I read my first book [**‚ÄúInfluence‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe Psychology of Persuasion‚Äù](http://libgen.is/search.php?req=Influence+the+psychology+of+persuasion&open=0&res=25&view=simple&phrase=1&column=def) **by **Robert B. Cialdini.**

### **3.** Implement learning in real world

The learning from the book worked magic for me in dealing with my stingy boss. Slowly I started feeling confident on topics which I was scared of once and started sharing whatever I learned or experienced from the last read with friends or family.

### **4.** Give your knowledge wings- Read>Grow>Read

It happened so that I was able to use the knowledge gained from reading in various aspects of my life situations. It initiated a chain reaction where more I read, more confident I felt which inspired me to read more.

### **5. Identify your fears**

Every fear I had once gave me an opportunity to search more and find its remedy. It was at this moment of time when I truly realized why they call books as our **best friend forever üôå**.

### **6. Highlight important points**

Soon I realized that it‚Äôs getting difficult to remember all the important points from books I have been binge reading from past few months, so I begin to highlight and save the take away points which I found good and worth remembering. **Adobe reader** does a brilliant job by saving all your highlighted points in one location so that you can quickly access them.

### **7.** Find your most comfortable routine

I am not a morning person really in terms of doing any activity which needs any sort of compilation work such as reading. I prefer doing yoga and meditation in early hours of my day. So, for me it was really comfortable to read for **15 min** just before going to bed every night. This routine was so fulfilling and eventually I started falling asleep to reading instead of radio songs.

### **8. Don‚Äôt pressurize yourself in to reading**

No need to buy a book, no preparation needed to read, just follow **step 2, **search for the bestsellers and read to find solutions for the problems you are struggling with in your professional or personal life.

### **10.** Remove all barriers to reading

Placing an order online for a book and then waiting for it to arrive can become a big barrier to reading sometimes specially when you have just decided to give reading a try. And then spending money for something you are not sure is worth it is another hurdle to start. Hence go to this awesome website mentioned below and download the e-book for free ‚Äî

*Go to** libgen.is** and search with book title or author. They say*** don‚Äôt judge a book by its cover*** and hence I request not to judge** libgen.is** by its **UI**. It is by far the best ebook library I have come across and you would love it too.*

### 11. Share and collect some good karma points

Create a brief summary of the best take away points in your words and start putting it on internet. That‚Äôs exactly what I am doing right now. Writing makes your thoughts more clear and creates better neural links enabling you to keep your learning with you for long long time. And of course if someone could benefit from your advice, you get good karma points.

### **12. **Appreciate yourself

Try this now and appreciate yourself for spending 3 min on reading this article and I promise you will feel happy‚Ä¶Your time and energy are precious. You choose to use it for a constructive purpose and for that you should feel good. And to feel good, don‚Äôt seeks appreciation outside, find it within...This will give you *will-power* to continue reading everyday from today. Say it *‚Äú**I love myself **‚Äù*

### 13. Go to Step 2 again once you have solved your problem you started with in search of a solution.

**Reading is an addiction. A man who can but doesn‚Äôt read is as good as a hungry man who has food to eat but he never tried chewing.**

**Either learn by reading what others have learned from their mistakes or wait to do that mistake yourself and then learn.**

**So folks, hail the technology that you no longer have to wait to savor the holy grail of knowledge. Drink! Drink! Drink! üç∫üç∫**

If someone would ask me what I need most to survive on my own, my answer would be a famous line written by Sarah J. Maas who said‚Ää‚Äî
> # ‚ÄúNo. I can survive well enough on my own ‚Äî if given the proper reading material.‚Äù
